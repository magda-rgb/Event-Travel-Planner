# 🌍 Event & Travel Planner <some cooler name in the future>

**Event & Travel Planner** is a web application developed as part of a bachelor’s thesis project. Its goal is to combine event management with travel planning — including accommodation and transportation — into one integrated platform.

The application consists of:
- a **backend** built with **FastAPI**
- a **frontend** built with **React**

The project is currently in its **first stage of development**, focusing on building the core architecture, API structure, and user management. In later stages, the application will be expanded with more advanced features and integrations.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main objective of the application is to create a system that:
1. Allows users to browse and search for events (concerts, conferences, festivals, etc.)
2. Lets users select a specific event
3. Automatically suggests optimal:
   - **transportation options**
   - **accommodation options**

based on the event location, date, and user preferences.

This way, users do not need to use multiple separate services — all travel logistics related to attending an event are handled in one place.

## 🧱 Current Scope

At the current stage, the application provides:
- user registration and authentication
- browsing and searching for events
- an API for managing users
- basic frontend–backend integration

The system currently uses JSON files as a temporary data storage solution.

## 🔮 Planned Development

In future stages, the project will be expanded with:
- accommodation booking system
- transportation search and comparison
- recommendation engine
- user accounts with booking history
- integration with external APIs (transport providers, hotels, maps)

---

## 🧪 Academic Context

This project serves both as:
- a real-world web application
- and a research & development platform for a bachelor’s thesis

The system architecture is designed to be modular and easily extendable, allowing experimentation with new algorithms and future integrations.
